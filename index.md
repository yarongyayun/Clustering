## Clustering Overview

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/yarongyayun/Clustering/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### What is Clustering?

Clustering is finding similarities between data according to the characteristics found in the data and grouping similar data objects into clusters.

In machine learning, we often group examples as a first step to understand a subject (data set) in a machine learning system. Grouping unlabeled examples is called **clustering**. 

It is an optimization problem.
* Variability (c) [Sum(distance(mean(c),e)square)]
* Dissimilarity (C) [Sum(variability)]
* Apply Constrian (e.g. minium distance)
* Purity of clusters
* Scaling

### What are the Users of Clustering?
Used for:
* Understanding: what is in a dataset
* Summarization: reduce the size of large datasets
* Data smoothing and discretization
* Features for other learning tasks

Typical applications:
* As a stand-alone tool to get insight into data distribution
* As a preprocessing step for other algorithms


Clustering has a myriad of uses in a variety of industries. Some common applications for clustering include the following:

* market segmentation: help marketers discover distinct groups in their customer bases, and then use this knowledge to develop targeted marketing programs
* social network analysis
* search result grouping
* medical imaging
* image segmentation
* anomaly detection

After clustering, each cluster is assigned a number called a cluster ID. Now, you can condense the entire feature set for an example into its cluster ID. 

Distance Types:
* Jaccard distance: Document = set of words
* Euclidean distance: Document = point in space of words
* Cosine distance: vector in space of words (vector from ofigin to x1, x2...)

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/yarongyayun/Clustering/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
